The idea to provide simple API to spreadsheets is very powerful. You can easily put data there and then analyze and report this data using all spreadsheet functionalities.

You can find a few use cases (with code!) for SpreadAPI below. If you have a nice use case to share let me know at [mateusz@roombelt.com](mailto:mateusz@roombelt.com).

{% content-ref url="sign-up-form.md" %}
[sign-up-form.md](sign-up-form.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="404-reporting.md" %}
[404-reporting.md](404-reporting.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
