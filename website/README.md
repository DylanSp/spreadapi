# Introduction

SpreadAPI is a free Google Apps Script that allows you to add REST API to any spreadsheet in Google Sheets in a few minutes. The API can be accessed over HTTPS from back-end as well as front-end apps.

SpreadAPI is a free alternative to tools like [sheetsu.com](https://sheetsu.com/), [sheetdb.io](https://sheetdb.io/) or [sheety.co](https://sheety.co/). With SpreadAPI you get just the same but for free. Moreover, you don't share the data with any third party because the code runs on your account as a Google Apps Script.
